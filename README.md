# Cratesearch.nvim
Cratesearch.nvim is a plugin for Rustaceans to search [crates.io](https://crates.io/) directly from their Neovim.<br>
![Cratesearch Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aityz/readme-assets/main/ss.png)<br>
## üî• Features
- Easily configurable, just pass the table of options to the setup function.
- Easy to use, call ``:CrateSearch [query]`` and you can search.
## üöÄ Usage
To use cratesearch, you can use the command ``:CrateSearch [QUERY]``. This will make a HTTP request to crates.io's API (endpoint is https://crates.io/api/v1), and use that data to create a window where you can view the search results. To make this easier to use, in my personal configuration I remapped ``cs`` to ``:CrateSearch``, to allow for easier searching. This is recommended if you don't have anything bound to ``cs`` yet.
## üìö Dependencies
- Neovim >=0.9 (compiled with Lua JIT)
- Cargo (get it from [here](https://rustup.rs))
- Curl (should already be installed on most systems)
